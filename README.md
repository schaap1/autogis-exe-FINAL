### Instructions

*you can remote these instructions for the final submission*

Read the final assignment instructions from the course webpages [https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/FA/final-assignment.html). Remember to write readable code, and to provide adequate documentation using inline comments and markdown. Organize all your code(s) / notebook(s) into this repository and **add links to all relevant files to this `README.md`file**. In sum, anyone who downloads this repository should be able to **read your code and documentation** and understand what is going on, and **run your code** in order to reproduce the same results! :) 

**Modify this readme so that anyone reading it gets a quick overview of your final work topic, and finds all the necessary input data, code and results.** 

*Note: If your code requires some python packages not found in the csc notebooks environment, please mention them also in this readme and provide installation instrutions.*

*Note: Don't upload large files into GitHub! If you are using large input files, provide downloading instructions and perhaps a small sample of the data in this repository for demonstrating your workflow.*

Fill in details of your final project below. You can remove this instructions-section from the README-file if you want.
